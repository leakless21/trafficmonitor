## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Video Stream Processing

- The system shall be able to ingest video streams from various sources (e.g., local video files, IP cameras).
- The system shall decode video frames for further processing.

### FR2: Vehicle Detection

- The system shall detect vehicles within each video frame.
- The system shall identify the bounding box, confidence score, and class ID for each detected vehicle.
- The system shall support configurable confidence thresholds for detection.
- The system shall utilize a pre-trained YOLO model for object detection.

### FR3: Vehicle Tracking

- The system shall track detected vehicles across multiple frames, assigning a unique track ID to each persistent object.
- The system shall update tracked objects with their current bounding box, confidence, and class information.
- The system shall support configurable tracker types (e.g., ByteTrack).
- The system shall allow for the integration of Re-ID models for improved tracking accuracy.

### FR4: Multiprocessing Architecture

- The system shall utilize a multiprocessing architecture to handle frame grabbing, vehicle detection, and vehicle tracking concurrently.
- The system shall use inter-process communication (queues) for passing data between modules.
- The system shall support graceful shutdown of all processes.

### FR5: Configuration Management

- The system shall load configuration parameters from a YAML file (`settings.yaml`).
- The system shall allow configuration of video sources, model paths, confidence thresholds, and tracker parameters.

### FR6: Logging

- The system shall implement structured logging for debugging, informational, and error messages.
- The system shall support configurable log levels and formats.
- The system shall provide detailed class-specific logging for vehicle detection, tracking, and counting.
- The system shall log specific vehicle class names (e.g., "car", "bicycle", "truck") instead of generic "vehicle" terms.
- The system shall include track IDs and class information in vehicle crossing detection logs.
- The system shall provide class-specific count summaries in detection and tracking logs.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance

- The system shall process video frames with minimal latency to support near real-time traffic monitoring.
- The tracking component should be optimized for efficient processing of detections.

### NFR2: Scalability

- The multiprocessing architecture should allow for potential scaling of individual components (e.g., running multiple detectors or trackers).

### NFR3: Maintainability

- The codebase shall adhere to a clear project structure and modular design.
- The code shall include type hints and docstrings for improved readability and maintainability.

### NFR4: Reliability

- The system shall handle empty input queues and gracefully manage process shutdowns.
- The system shall log errors and exceptions for debugging.
